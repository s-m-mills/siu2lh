				<br>
				<b>What is Conceptual Research?</b>
				<br>
				I do not consider myself to be an especially good writer, or especially talented when it comes to being published in academic journals. Obviously, <a href="https://www.siu2lh.com/papers.html">I have been</a>. But equally, I know many people who are far better at both getting published, and at writing, than I am. The idea that I might have advice for people on these topics has, thus, always seemed a bit odd to me.
				<br>
				<br>
				Nevertheless, I have found myself receiving requests for writing tips in recent years. The only sensible explanation I can come up with is that I know how to write in a particular niche. Specifically, how to write conceptual papers. I am a terrible empiricist, and as some of my <a href="https://siu2lh.com/articles/what-will-ai-do-to-us.html">previous writing</a> on this blog will attest, do not necessarily place <i>that much</i> primacy in empirical work, anyway. Almost everything I have ever published has been conceptual and I see no reason to change that. It will hold back my career, and deny me opportunities to be published in <i>Nature</i> or <i>Science</i> or wherever, but I don't mind too much. I write because I enjoy writing, not because I expect anyone to read it. And if my writing is <i>enjoyable</i>, I don't really care where it is published.
				<br>
				<br>
				Of course, this is me speaking from a place of privilege. Right now, I have enough stuff published in good enough places to not worry about a) my job; or b) my reputation. If I fail to maintain this, a) and b) will, sooner or later, become concerns. But right now, things are fine, so I am more flippant than perhaps some academics might be. Hence why I get asked 'how to write conceptual papers?' Many academics, particularly PhD students, struggle to get things published. Most academics are empiricists, which comes with pros and cons so far as the publication game goes. The pro is that empirical papers are reasonably easy to write. There is a standard formula in terms of structure, and assuming a good grasp of methods, the actual writing part tends not to be too difficult. The difficulty with empirical papers comes in two parts. Firstly, data takes a while to collect, so one cannot produce too many empirical papers too quickly. Secondly, null results are harder to publish than statistically significant results. While the latter is <a href="https://www.nature.com/nature-index/news/top-tips-for-dealing-with-non-significant-null-results">slowly changing</a>, apparently, the interaction of these parts is simply that empirical research is a gamble, where a researcher must invest their time in the hope that the data yields a publishable result. If not, by your choice or some editor's, the paper will likely end up languishing in a folder which is eventually lost whenever you next upgrade your computer.
				<br>
				<br>
				Conceptual papers are different. Conceptual papers are essentially ideas about how other ideas interact. I do not use the word 'theory' here, because conceptual papers do not necessarily need to explain data, whereas theory is much more tied to data and empirical work. Conceptual work is all about proposing ideas, and suggesting tweaks and criticisms of old ideas. Of suggesting intellectual paths forward, not because one <i>knows</i> the way, but because one <i>thinks</i> that way looks interesting. Another word I do not want to use is 'opinion', but on this point I cannot claim that there is <i>no</i> opinion involved in conceptual work. I think most conceptualists write about ideas that they mostly agree with, and point in directions that they <i>already</i> kind of want to go down. Certainly, I do. I am not sure my heart would be in a conceptual paper that posited something completely contradictory to what I believe. Yet, I also think 'opinion' is too shallow of a word, and certainly one which leaves conceptual work too vulnerable for attack. Good conceptual work may be <i>motivated</i> by opinions, but will stand not on some opinionated defence but upon a diverse body of evidence, by which I mean other relevant empirical, theoretical, and conceptual work. To give a hypothetical, say two pieces of empirical evidence contradict one another. The empiricist looks for a <i>problem</i> in the data. The theoretician develops a theory which <i>accomodates</i> the contradiction. And the conceptualist questions the <i>perspective</i> from which a contradiction seems to arise. The conceptualist does not <i>solve</i> the contradiction in the same way that the empiricist and theoretician try to. Rather, they make efforts to <i>resolve</i> the contradiction by pointing to alternative ideas which might prompt us to reconsider the contradiction itself.
				<br>
				<br>
				Maybe this is easy, or perhaps it is difficult. I am not too sure. Regardless, because conceptual papers have this element of 'pointing in a new direction', requiring only a knowledge of a field's key ideas and recent challenges, there is this perception that one can write conceptual papers quickly, and thus academically, cheaply. While empirical work is timely and risky, conceptual papers, I have heard some suggest, are fast and reliable. Reliability, here, does not mean that <i>all</i> conceptual work can be published in some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokal_affair">Sokal Affair-esque farce</a>. Rather, conceptual work is reliable in the sense that if one throws many darts at a dartboard, even if most miss, some will score near (or on) the bullseye. The 'cheapness' of conceptual work makes conceptual work 'reliable' for one who needs to publish <i>something</i> because you get many throws of the dart. Or, so the story goes.
				<br>
				<br>
				As a conceptualist, I am not convinced by this argument. It is certainly true that if I want three publications a year, I must plan to write six and anticipate a 50% failure rate. But good conceptual work, in my opinion, is never just one paper. A good conceptualist (if I am one) treats ideas like Lego pieces, constantly constructing and deconstructing combinations to see what happens. What looks like a success--a published paper--is often a missmash of many previous papers; an ideational Frankenstein's monster. I am not sure this kind of academic work can be accurately measured in terms of 'time to publication.' Neither am I confident one can measure the 'publication success rate' of conceptual work (when understood as a construction of ideas, rather than as published academic papers). That conceptual work is easier than empirical or theoretical work is, in my opinion, a falsity, but I will not deny that conceptual work does allow one more shots at that publication dartboard.
				<br>
				<br>
				In the spirit of some of the tips I am going to offer here, I have decided to structure the rest of this blogpost in a series of self-contained, hopefully memorable, tips for success. I have no idea if following these ideas will lead to publication success, or even good conceptual work (again, these are not, in my opinion, the same thing). But, in the spirit of conceptual writing, these ideas represent possible paths to take, and ones which I think look interesting.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tip #1: Conceptual Papers Have Results</b>
				<br>
				From the introduction, it is hopefully obvious that I do not think conceptual work is worthless, or worthy of the denigration that may sometimes be levied at it by researchers more inclined towards empirical work. My opposition to criticism of conceptual work goes so far as to mount a defence in the language of those who might attack it. It is not only that good conceptual work proposes interesting ideas, or muses on worthwhile criticisms. Good conceptual work <i>has results</i>. For an empiricist, I encourage one to take this point quite literally. When one is writing a conceptual paper, one should mentally plan out where the 'results' section is going to be, and how one is going to get there.
				<br>
				<br>
				Results within conceptual papers differ just as they do in empirical work. An empiricist might be quantitatively or qualitatively minded, and within those broad categories, might specialise in methods which change what constitutes a 'results' section. Likewise, a conceptual paper will have different results depending on what the author is trying to achieve, where they are positioning the paper (see tip #2), and what their background is. The most common conceptual paper is perhaps the framework paper. Here, the 'results' should be quite obvious, provided one has taken this tip on board. The framework is the result, and the paper must be packaged as such. The 'result' (in this instance, the framework), must be well articulated. This is (again) related to tip #2, but should be stressed here primarily because most people do not think that conceptual work produces discrete results. If a reviewer or reader does not have this mindset, it falls on the author to force them to see that what you are presenting is a result to a legitimate question. Today, too much emphasis is on branding frameworks with memorable mnemonics and engaging visuals. But if it is not clear why your framework matters, the branding is irrelevant (sometimes, of course, branding can be the conceptual contribution. There is much to be said for simplification as a contribution). When Richard Whittle and I wrote our conceptual paper on nudge evaluation, we even created a figure which showed how our framework fit into the existing 'framework ecosystem' of behavioural policymaking. This helped us convince reviewers that we had a clear result (call it a contribution) beyond merely criticising or speculating.
				<br>
				<br>
				I would generally advise, with something like a conceptual framework, that the framework be shown early on in the paper. Most of the paper should be orientated, essentially, towards explaining how one arrives at the result. While it can be intellectually satisfying to put all of the pieces in front of the reader, and then like Sherlock Holmes elegantly demonstrate at the end how the pieces fit together, this is often too late. In a conceptual paper, if you bury the lead, you will kill your paper. In empirical work, there are often writing tricks which keep readers engaged. A criticism of a method, or of data analysis, or something else, is engaging and can be considered self-evidently important. Furthermore, once these criticisms have been made, stating that, "this paper responds to the weaknesses of previous investigations by..." does the job of clearly articulating not just what the contribution of the paper is, but <i>where the result is going to come from</i>. As above, because readers do not anticipate results from a conceptual paper in the same way that they do in an empirical study, it is incumbant on a conceptual author to spell this out. One cannot write a conceptual paper as one would an empirical paper, starting with an ordered list of criticisms which reveal problems which the current work will solve. Readers of conceptual work, who do not <i>anticipate</i> a result, will simply interpret those criticisms as <i>critique</i>, and let the critique wash over them. If one gives the 'result' of the paper only at the end, one is relying on the reader to have done intellectual work--to have recognised the conceptual pieces you are laying out in front of them as pieces, rather than self-aggrandising prose.
				<br>
				<br>
				At the heart of the idea that 'conceptual papers have results' is a recognition that and much conceptual work does not give itself a clear reason for existing. Conceptual researchers are usually of a particular type that prefers meandering conversations which lead to nowhere over focused conversations with clear results. That is a fair description of me, and I think, of many of the conceptualists I know and respect (and, unsurprisingly, enjoy talking to). This type of researcher must battle against the tendency to believe that the importance of what they are saying is self-evident, and must battle against the (often subconscious) distaste for the regimented style of empirical work. Good conceptual work borrows from empirical work by presenting ideas and criticisms themselves as results. Most frameworks, for instance, are simply tools for helping others think in a way the conceptualist already does, and to apply ideas the conceptualist has already convinced themselves are important. Understanding that conceptual work has results, and that conceptual papers should have a kind of 'results' section, is essential to ensuring that one's work has a clear reason for existing (though, as tip #3 demonstrates, <i>what</i> this reason is can be quite complicated).
				<br>
				<br>
				I would note that the call for conceptual work to have a results section is becoming less abstract and more standard. Several weeks ago, I was reading the <i>Strategic Management Journal</i>--a very good journal--and I noticed that all of the conceptual papers (e.g., framework papers) published there had an applied element. This is to say, note only was a framework developed, but it was then applied and the results of the application discussed. I am nor surprised that a journal like the SMJ would want empirical testing of conceptual ideas. The not infrequent derision shown to conceptual work can be ameliorated by attaching some of the intellectual seriousness of empirical research. Minimising derision, and maximising seriousness, is almost always a concern for top journals. I have also experienced reviewer comments which have asked for practical details, or a case study discussion, to elevate the conceptual result to something beyond 'just some guy's opinion.' Thus, I understand this tendency, and I do not inherently disagree with it. Though, for a burgeoning conceptual researcher, it is important to recognise that in some journals, and in some disciplines, the march of empirical research is now across conceptual territory. I do not know, with pressures on higher education to deliver 'impact' and 'value-for-money', or just clicks on social media platforms, how much longer pure conceptual work has left. Tip #3, below, offers some recourse to this challenge.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Tip #2: Know Who You Are Pissing Off</b>
				<br>
				On the one hand, making enemies is often a bad idea, or at the least, not a pleasant endeavour. On the other hand, as I think Margaret Thatcher once mused, a person who has no enemies has achieved nothing of consequence.
