				<b>Introduction</b>
				<br>
				I have spent less time reading this quarter than I would have liked, for various reasons. I have still be able to read some books, some of which I enjoyed and several of which I did not. It has long been a view of mine that there are books that should be written, books that should not, and books that are written because that is what the author does. Obviously, the former should be encouraged and the middle discouraged. But what of those books who are written by 'people who write books?' Of this, I am less sure. Most of these are terrible, and not necessarily because the author is a bad writer, or ignorant. It is more the audiences for whom they are intended. Books written by those who write books tend to be too dumbed down while revelling in their own smartness, because I suppose that is what the typical Waterstones shopper wants--to feel smart without ever being challenged. It is no surprise that people who write books subsequently write books that meet this criterion, and end up being disappointing as a result. <i>Equally</i>, I had the idea that knowledge should be inaccessible or otherwise gatekept, and I suppose to the extent that people who write books also write <i>accessible</i> books, I cannot fault them of that. I just wish there were a bit more humility; a bit more acknowledgement that what is being given is a disgestible synthesis, rather than the definitive article. I also recognise that, as an academic, I am often a much more functional reader, than someone who reads for pleasure, and from that perspective, I am more likely than most to be peaved off at books that skirt detail in exchange for delicate prose. Anyway...
				<br>
				<br>
				Below is my list of books I plan on reading:
				<br>
				<br>
				1. Super Imperialism, Michael Hudson
				<br>
				2. How Not to Network a Nation, Benjamin Peters
				<br>
				3. The Rise of Modern Chinese Thought, Wang Hui
				<br>
				4. Determined, Robert Sapolsky
				<br>
				5. Nuclear War, Annie Jacobsen
				<br>
				6. Cybernetic Revolutionaries, Eden Medina
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>You Are Not A Gadget, Jaron Lanier</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				Hot off a streak of reading Illich, I had anticipated a degree of radicalism from Lanier which I might associate with my favourites, such as Illich or Feyerabend. It's not so much I had hoped Lanier to be some kind of subversive anarchist; but I had heard he held cutting, alternative views on the state of the web, and I thought they'd be quite valuable to consider. Now, I should begin by noting that 'You Are Not A Gadget' is somewhat dated now, and I do know that Lanier has written much since. Having not read his more recent work, it is not fair for me to comment on what Lanier might believe now, as I am sure his views will have evolved.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have a few problems with the politics of this book. It strikes me that it exists in the same universe as the typical thing one might find written in the Guardian between 2006-2012. Something born of a mindset that says: liberal democracy has won, left-wing structural critique is unhelpful and dead, and all problems we have now just require a bit of rational, good-faith debate. I am not saying that Lanier thinks this. But there is a certain brand of liberalism throughout this book which I think, in retrospect, is pretty much dead, or at the least, a zombie. A good contrast with 'You Are Not A Gadget', I think, would be Evgeny Morozov's 2012 book 'The Net Delusion'. A reader will know that Morozov spends much of this book criticising the delusions of liberal politicians who believed the internet and related technologies to be 'democratising' forces, rather than capable of what has actually happened, which is creating reality out of Aldous Huxley's fiction.
				<br>
				<br>
				I do not think Lanier is as deluded as some of those Morozov mocks, though I do think in 2009 he was probably attentive to some of the same conversations, at least insofar as considering alternative political approaches. I will try and emphasise some positives to wrap up. Lanier's defence of paying for information I found challenging, and certainly has prompted me to rethink my views on the (financial) freedom of information. Incidentally, this is an example of the type of politics I'm criticising. I am inclined to see something like music as something one pursues intrinsically, and to argue that policies should exist to allow each of us the material comfort to pursue our intrinsic interests. We do not need to be paid to make music; if we already have what we would buy, then all we must do is sing. For Lanier, art exists within an economic system that essentially is not to be challenged (by which I mean, in 2009, was not necessarily <i>going</i> to be challenged), and therefore the internet represents a <i>threat</i> to artistic creation, rather than a means of liberating creation. As above, I find this interesting and I am not settled on my views. Another aspect of Lanier's book which I liked was when he (briefly) began describing what alternative information technologies could look like. Discussions of transforming humans into cephalods with virtual reality, or how programming a human function crystallises functionality and almost accidentally separates the important from the superfluous, I thought was interesting. I would have liked more of this, throughout.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Only the Paranoid Survive, Andrew Grove</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				I read this book as a result of reading Chris Miller's 'Chip War'. It probably would not have appealed to be too much, otherwise. I will not say much about Grove's book because it is quite short, and in some ways feels more like a memoir of his time running Intel than a book on business strategy. Certainly, the writing style is that of a CEO, and I appreciated some aspects of the brevity, and the meta-commentary (e.g., Grove argues businesses that are about to face market challenges typically have CEOs who are spending their time doing other things, and he notes that he has spent much of this time writing this book, so maybe Intel is about to face a big challenge).
				<br>
				<br>
				In quite typical Harvard Business School fashion, the book is all about 'strategic inflection points'. These are moments when a business must take a large risk, often changing how and what it does, to survive a changing marketplace. The major example discussed is Intel switching from manufacturing memory chips to CPUs, a product which is still its bread and butter today. Grove supplements his practical discussions with various observations which I think could also be found in various work on bounded rationality, from Simon onwards of course, but also in the work of people like James March. I am unsure how much Grove was aware of these thinkers, and had 'Only the Paranoid Survive' been written as a more academic book I would have perhaps expected this literature to be addressed. As it stands, the book is a typical business book, though not one wirtten by the typical person who writes books (see above), and so is quite a bit better than your average business book.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Innovator's Dilemma, Clayton Christensen</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				My relationship with this book is a bit perplexing, because I really want to like it, and in places, I really do. I am sympathetic to some of the methods that Christensen uses, and I love someone who is willing to really get into the fine, often esoteric detail, to try and offer commentary on wider phenomenon. That is a big part of Christensen's contribution with this book. The problem is, I'm not necessarily convinced that Christensen is right.
				<br>
				<br>
				OK, I can't say it was wholly my own realisation. <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/06/23/the-disruption-machine">This article</a> by Jill Lepore (more on her brilliant work, later) helped me see a lot of things which changed my opinion on 'The Innovator's Dillema'. Christensen's basic idea is that as businesses develop, new innovations change the shape of the markets in which they operate. New uses of their products and knowledge which were not previously profitable may become so, while established uses may fall out of favour. The net result is that businesses which do everything right may still fail. This is a dramatic headline. It is very much in the same vein of Grove--again, this was a recommendation I got from 'Chip War'--and very much of the Harvard Business School brain (Christensen was a PhD and then professor at HBS). It's a fun idea. But as Lepore points out, the case studies which Christensen uses are a bit too cherry-picked, while a more critical eye may come to a rather different theory of innovation than Christensen's 'disruptive innovation' perspective.
				<br>
				<br>
				I am not an innovation scholar, so I plead ignorance for lack of an opinion. I will say a couple of things, though. Christensen's doctrine of innovation is basically the gospel of modern Silicon Valley, and--in my opinion--Silicon Valley has been tremendously successful at innovating a whole bunch of shit nobody wants or needs. This being so, actively embracing disruptive innovation, rather than focusing on practical applications and consistent improvement, has probably lead to a tremendous amount of wasted time, talent, and rare earth metals (to name but a few). I'd also note that Christensen is a fan of 'illustrative graphs'. These are figures, or diagrams, that are not constructed from quantitative data, but are more so meant to help convey qualitative ideas. I am a fan of 'illustrative graphs', but they have to capture a core idea in a sensible and, preferably, enhancing way. Christensen's graphs do not do this. They are bad. I have notes where I have redrawn them in ways which I think are better. Now, I know critiquing graphs is somewhat silly--surely, it is the big idea that matters! But when one combines these oversights with critiques such as Lepore's, I find myself struggling to take the book all that seriously. Interesting case studies meet a desperate attempt to say something new to appeal the gods of the Harvard Business School. Insofar as I think Christensen was one of the first academics to be caught in this bind, writing just before the turn of the millenium, he was perhaps an innovator for many less interesting academics to follow.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>The Road to Freedom</b>
				<br>
				<br>
				I found myself without much to read at the same time that Joseph Stiglitz's latest book was released, and so it seemed like a worthwhile product to pick up. I have always liked Stiglitz, and I don't dislike this book. I have always been sceptical of Hayek, and I was intrigued to see what Stiglitz might do with that contrast. I'm not sure much has ultimately been done.
				<br>
				<br>
				Stiglitz's schtick in 'The Road to Freedom' is that Milton Friedman and Friedrich Hayek supplied various economic ideas which have now led us to adopt policies that constrain, rather than expand, our freedom. Stiglitz makes various sensible arguments for how different policies would provide us more freedom, and in that sense, the book is worthwhile. But from a political perspective, it strikes me as a bit naive. There is little sense of a project, or a vision beyond the notion that he, being a distinguished economist, talks sense. It is, in some ways, a very liberal perspective that holds that those who disagree with us have simply not yet been exposed to our arguments, and the information we are privy to. This perspective, though, falls down in two ways. Firstly, there is a selection bias--no one reading Stiglitz's book is really going to disagree with Stiglitz, and those whom he needs to convince are not those paying £25 for it. Secondly, those who <i>do</i> disagree with Stiglitz do so as a result of decades of ideological engineering, not because they are simply ignorant of Stiglitz's perspective. Do not misunderstand me--I do not doubt that there <i>is</i> ignorance of Stiglitz's perspective by, say, disciples of Friedman and Hayek. But erasing this ignorance is only a necessary, not <i>sufficient</i> condition for affecting political change in this group of believers. To cease burying the lead--Hayek and Friedman spent decades building up institutional clout, developing propaganda agents, undermining alternative perspectives, and so on. Yes, there was 'The Road to Serfdom' and 'Capitalism and Freedom' and so on. But there was <i>also</i> a deep political project engineered by these thinkers and their immediate disciples. There was a plan to institutionalise their ideas. Stiglitz, rightly, challenges these ideas. But he challenges them in an academic way--pointing out the wrongness of these ideas in terms of the ends they seek to achieve. But this is not <i>why</i> these ideas prosper. Indeed, if wrongness mattered, they would have already failed. They have succeeded because of political efforts. And it is the politics of economics, not the economics itself, which must be tackled so as to affect <i>political and</i> economic change.
				<br>
				<br>
				I have no doubt that Stiglitz knows this. I was surprised, in fact, to see much many left-wing thinkers--new and old--that Stiglitz was drawing on. It can hardly have slipped his mind that there is politics at play here, nor do I doubt he is aware of things like Mont Pelerin, the society which channelled many of Hayek's and Friedman's ideas into policy and influence. But I do not see an eagerness in Stiglitz to put the political gloves on and, to mix metaphors, start slinging some mud. I do not blame him either. But in the absense of a bold political project to back up 'The Road to Freedom', one cannot help but see this book as little more than a 'book for those who read books'--liberals who want to look enlightened--rather than what it could (and in another universe, might actually) be.
